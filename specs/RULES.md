# Rules

This file defines the shared rule contract. Every implementation should use the
same rule IDs, severities, finding paths, messages, and descriptions for shared
rules.

## Shared Repository Rules

| Rule ID                | Severity | Finding path        | Finding message                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `repo.readme-required` | `error`  | `README.md`         | `README.md is required`                                              |
| `repo.agents-required` | `error`  | `AGENTS.md`         | `AGENTS.md is required`                                              |
| `repo.ci-required`     | `error`  | `.github/workflows` | `.github/workflows must contain at least one .yml or .yaml workflow` |
| `repo.slophammer-ci-required` | `error` | `.github/workflows` | `CI must run a Slophammer checker when slophammer.yml is present` |

## Binding Evidence

Command-presence rules accept evidence only from steps that can run and can
fail. Workflow YAML is parsed structurally: steps and jobs with a literal
`continue-on-error: true` or a literal-false `if:` condition contribute
nothing, and a workflow contributes nothing unless its triggers can fire for
integration — `pull_request`, `pull_request_target`, `merge_group`,
`schedule`, or `push` whose branch filter is absent, wildcarded, or names an
integration branch (`main`, `master`, `trunk`, `develop`). A `push` filter
that defines only `tags` or `tags-ignore` is a release trigger, not
integration CI: it never fires for branch pushes, so it contributes
nothing. A `branches-ignore` filter still fires for branch pushes and
stays binding. Surviving steps
contribute their `run` script and their `uses:` action reference.

Scripts, Makefiles, Taskfiles, and justfiles count as evidence only when
binding workflow evidence invokes them (a script by name; runner files
through `make`, `task`, or `just`), following script-to-script references one
level deep. `package.json` scripts count only when invoked by name from
binding evidence, with one level of chained run-script references.

Mutation evidence must be able to fail: list, scan, check, dry-run, and
manifest-only forms (`cargo mutants --list`, `cargo mutants --check`,
`mutate --scan`, `mutate --update-manifest`, `stryker --dryRunOnly`,
`mutmut results`) enumerate, build, or baseline without executing a single
mutant against the tests, so they are not mutation-testing evidence.
Diff-scoped and incremental executing forms count. Tools that execute
mutants but exit zero when they survive are held to the same bar: bare
`mutate4go` and bare `mutmut run` are not gates, so Go credits only the
`slophammer-go mutate` wrapper and Python credits the kill-rate check
(`--min-kill-rate`) or `cr-rate --fail-over` beside `cosmic-ray exec`.

Accepted limitations: expressions are only neutralizing when literal — the
checkers ship no expression evaluator, so a non-literal always-false
condition stays credited. Reusable workflows (`uses:` at the job level) stay
credited without following the reference. Unparseable workflow YAML stays
credited as raw text, so structural filtering can only remove false passes.

## Go Rules

Go rules apply only when the target appears to be a Go project. A repo appears
to be a Go project when it contains Go source, a `go.mod` file, or declared Go
commands.

| Rule ID                             | Severity | Finding path                   | Finding message                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `go.module-required`                | `error`  | `go.mod`                       | `Go projects must include a go.mod file`                       |
| `go.tests-required`                 | `error`  | `.github/workflows`            | `Go projects must declare go test ./... in CI or scripts`      |
| `go.vet-required`                   | `error`  | `.github/workflows`            | `Go projects must declare go vet ./... in CI or scripts`       |
| `go.lint-required`                  | `error`  | `.golangci.yml`                | `Go projects must configure and declare golangci-lint`         |
| `go.coverage-required`              | `error`  | `scripts/check-go-coverage.sh` | `Go projects must declare a coverage gate`                     |
| `go.complexity-required`            | `error`  | `.golangci.yml`                | `Go projects must enable a complexity linter`                  |
| `go.dry-required`                   | `error`  | `.github/workflows`            | `Go projects must declare a DRY check`                         |
| `go.crap-required`                  | `error`  | `.github/workflows`            | `Go projects must declare crap4go with a threshold`            |
| `go.mutation-required`              | `error`  | `.github/workflows`            | `Go projects must declare mutate4go`                           |
| `go.dependency-boundaries-required` | `error`  | `slophammer.yml`               | `Go projects must respect configured dependency boundaries`    |
| `go.scope-incomplete`               | `error`  | `slophammer.yml`               | `Configured Go scope must cover all production files or exclude them with reasons` |
| `go.suppressions-justified`         | `error`  | `.`                            | `nolint directives in production Go code must carry a reason`  |

## TypeScript Rules

TypeScript rules apply only when the target appears to be a TypeScript project.
A repo appears to be a TypeScript project when it contains `tsconfig.json`,
production `.ts` or `.tsx` source, or `package.json` TypeScript signals such as
the `typescript` package, `@typescript-eslint/*`, `tsc`, or a `typecheck`
script. `@types/*` packages alone do not make a JavaScript package a
TypeScript project.

| Rule ID                               | Severity | Finding path        | Finding message                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ts.package-required`                 | `error`  | `package.json`      | `TypeScript projects must include package.json`                |
| `ts.typecheck-required`               | `error`  | `.github/workflows` | `TypeScript projects must declare a no-emit typecheck in CI or scripts` |
| `ts.strict-required`                  | `error`  | `tsconfig.json`     | `TypeScript projects must enable strict mode`                  |
| `ts.no-explicit-any`                  | `error`  | `eslint.config.mjs` | `TypeScript projects must reject explicit any`                 |
| `ts.no-unsafe-types`                  | `error`  | `eslint.config.mjs` | `TypeScript projects must reject unsafe type operations`       |
| `ts.lint-required`                    | `error`  | `.github/workflows` | `TypeScript projects must declare a linter in CI or scripts`   |
| `ts.format-required`                  | `error`  | `.github/workflows` | `TypeScript projects must declare a formatter check`           |
| `ts.test-required`                    | `error`  | `.github/workflows` | `TypeScript projects must declare tests in CI or scripts`      |
| `ts.coverage-required`                | `error`  | `.github/workflows` | `TypeScript projects must declare a coverage gate`             |
| `ts.complexity-required`              | `error`  | `eslint.config.mjs` | `TypeScript projects must enforce complexity limits`           |
| `ts.dry-required`                     | `error`  | `.github/workflows` | `TypeScript projects must declare a DRY check`                 |
| `ts.mutation-required`                | `error`  | `.github/workflows` | `TypeScript projects must declare mutation testing`            |
| `ts.dependency-boundaries-required`   | `error`  | `slophammer.yml`    | `TypeScript projects must respect configured dependency boundaries` |
| `ts.scope-incomplete`                 | `error`  | `slophammer.yml`    | `Configured TypeScript scope must cover all production files or exclude them with reasons` |
| `ts.suppressions-justified`           | `error`  | `.`                 | `lint and type suppressions in production TypeScript code must carry a description` |

## Python Rules

Python rules apply only when the target appears to be a Python project. A
repo appears to be a Python project when it contains a non-conventional
`pyproject.toml`, a `setup.py`, or production `.py` source. For Python paths,
`migrations/` joins the conventional non-production list.

The strict-typing rule judges tool configuration as evidence: ty severities
in `ty.toml` or `[tool.ty]` plus invocation flags (no stable default-error
rule demoted without a reasoned `python.typecheck.demotions` override,
`error-on-warning` enabled, `missing-type-argument` and the `possibly-*`
correctness rules promoted to error, `respect-type-ignore-comments`
disabled), mypy `strict`/`disallow_untyped_defs` (with the pydantic plugin
when pydantic is a dependency), or pyright strict mode — and in every case
Ruff's ANN selection, so every production signature is annotated.

| Rule ID | Severity | Finding path | Finding message |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| `py.project-required` | `error` | `pyproject.toml` | `Python projects must declare a pyproject.toml` |
| `py.typecheck-required` | `error` | `.github/workflows` | `Python projects must run a typechecker (ty, mypy, or pyright) in CI` |
| `py.types-strict-required` | `error` | `pyproject.toml` | `Python typechecking must be strict` |
| `py.lint-required` | `error` | `.github/workflows` | `Python projects must run a linter (ruff check) in CI` |
| `py.format-required` | `error` | `.github/workflows` | `Python projects must verify formatting (ruff format --check or black --check) in CI` |
| `py.test-required` | `error` | `.github/workflows` | `Python projects must run tests (pytest) in CI` |
| `py.coverage-required` | `error` | `.github/workflows` | `Python projects must enforce a coverage gate of at least 85` |
| `py.complexity-required` | `error` | `pyproject.toml` | `Python projects must enforce complexity at most 8 (Ruff C901 or radon)` |
| `py.dry-required` | `error` | `.github/workflows` | `Python projects must declare a DRY check` |
| `py.mutation-required` | `error` | `.github/workflows` | `Python projects must declare mutation testing (mutmut or cosmic-ray)` |

| `py.dependency-boundaries-required` | `error` | `.` | `Python imports must respect the configured dependency boundaries` |
| `py.typed-marker-required` | `error` | `.` | `Published Python packages must ship a py.typed marker` |

| `py.scope-incomplete` | `error` | `slophammer.yml` | `Configured Python scope must cover all production files or exclude them with reasons` |

## Rust Rules

Rust rules apply only when the target appears to be a Rust project. A repo
appears to be a Rust project when it contains `Cargo.toml`, production `.rs`
source, or inspectable Cargo commands.

| Rule ID                               | Severity | Finding path        | Finding message                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rust.manifest-required`              | `error`  | `Cargo.toml`        | `Rust projects must include Cargo.toml`                        |

## Rule Descriptions

### `repo.readme-required`

The target repo should have a `README.md`.

The filename comparison is case-insensitive.

### `repo.agents-required`

The target repo should have an `AGENTS.md`.

The filename comparison is case-insensitive.

### `repo.ci-required`

The target repo should have a CI workflow under `.github/workflows`.

Any regular file directly under `.github/workflows` with a `.yml` or `.yaml`
extension satisfies the rule.

### `go.module-required`

Go projects should include a `go.mod` file.

The file may live at the repository root or inside a language implementation
directory such as `go/`.

### `go.tests-required`

Go projects should declare a `go test` command against `./...` in an
inspectable workflow or script. Common test flags before the package pattern are
accepted.

### `go.vet-required`

Go projects should declare `go vet ./...` in an inspectable workflow or script.

### `go.lint-required`

Go projects should configure `golangci-lint` and declare a lint check in CI or
scripts.

The rule accepts `.golangci.yml` or `.golangci.yaml`.

### `go.coverage-required`

Go projects should declare a coverage gate using coverage output from `go test`,
`go tool cover`, and a minimum threshold in a workflow or script that Slophammer
can inspect.

### `go.complexity-required`

Go projects should enable a complexity linter through `golangci-lint`.
Comments, settings, and disabled linter entries do not satisfy this rule.

The accepted linter names are:

- `cyclop`
- `gocognit`
- `gocyclo`

`linters.default: all` is also accepted because it enables the complexity
linters through golangci-lint.

### `go.dry-required`

Go projects should declare `slophammer-go dry` for structural and copied-block
duplicate detection.

Slophammer checks for an inspectable declaration. It does not run the DRY
engine in static mode. Existing `dry4go` and pre-rename `slophammer go dry`
declarations remain accepted as legacy evidence, but new repos should declare
the `slophammer-go` command.

### `go.crap-required`

Go projects should declare `crap4go` with a threshold for complexity and
coverage risk scoring.

Slophammer checks for an inspectable declaration and threshold. It does not run
`crap4go` in static mode.

### `go.mutation-required`

Go projects should declare `mutate4go` in an inspectable workflow or script.

The mutation command may live in a normal CI workflow, nightly workflow, manual
workflow, or script. Slophammer checks for a declaration in static mode.

### `go.dependency-boundaries-required`

Go projects should keep imports inside the dependency boundaries declared in
`slophammer.yml`.

The rule is active when `go.dependency_boundaries` contains at least one
boundary. External imports are ignored. Local imports are checked by resolving
the import path through the nearest `go.mod` module path.

Boundary paths may be written relative to the repository root or relative to the
Go module root. For example, both `go/internal/rules` and `internal/rules` can
describe the same package when the module root is `go/`.

### `ts.package-required`

TypeScript projects should include `package.json`.

The file may live at the repository root or inside a language implementation
directory such as `typescript/`.

### `ts.typecheck-required`

TypeScript projects should declare `tsc --noEmit`, `tsgo --noEmit`, or an
equivalent no-emit typecheck in an inspectable workflow, script, or
`package.json`. A script named `typecheck` does not satisfy this rule unless it
actually runs a TypeScript-compatible checker with `--noEmit`.

### `ts.strict-required`

TypeScript projects should enable `strict` compiler mode in the project
`tsconfig.json`.

### `ts.no-explicit-any`

TypeScript projects should configure ESLint, Oxlint, or an equivalent typed lint
rule to reject explicit `any`.

### `ts.no-unsafe-types`

TypeScript projects should configure ESLint, Oxlint, or an equivalent typed lint
rule to reject unsafe assignments, calls, member access, and returns.

### `ts.lint-required`

TypeScript projects should declare ESLint, Oxlint, Biome, or an equivalent
linter in CI, scripts, or `package.json`.

### `ts.format-required`

TypeScript projects should declare a formatter check through Prettier, Oxfmt,
Biome, Dprint, or an equivalent tool.

### `ts.test-required`

TypeScript projects should declare a real test command, such as Node's built-in
test runner, Vitest, Jest, or an equivalent runner.

### `ts.coverage-required`

TypeScript projects should declare a coverage gate. The recommended minimum is
`85`.

### `ts.complexity-required`

TypeScript projects should enforce complexity limits through a configured
linter. The recommended cyclomatic complexity maximum is `8`.

### `ts.dry-required`

TypeScript projects should declare `slophammer-ts dry` for native
copied-block duplicate detection.

Pre-rename `slophammer typescript dry` declarations remain accepted as legacy
evidence, but new repos should declare the `slophammer-ts` command.

### `rust.manifest-required`

Rust projects should include a `Cargo.toml` manifest.

### `rust.msrv-required`

Rust projects should declare a minimum supported Rust version using
`rust-version` in `Cargo.toml` or an equivalent pinned Rust toolchain version.

### `rust.check-required`

Rust projects should declare `cargo check` in an inspectable workflow or
script.

### `rust.fmt-required`

Rust projects should declare `cargo fmt --check` in an inspectable workflow or
script.

### `rust.clippy-required`

Rust projects should declare `cargo clippy` with warnings denied in an
inspectable workflow or script.

### `rust.test-required`

Rust projects should declare `cargo test` in an inspectable workflow or script.

### `rust.coverage-required`

Rust projects should declare an enforceable coverage gate. The preferred tool
is `cargo llvm-cov` with a visible threshold of at least `85`.

### `rust.complexity-required`

Rust projects should enforce complexity limits through Clippy configuration or
Slophammer-owned Rust complexity policy. The recommended cognitive complexity
maximum is `8`.

### `rust.dry-required`

Rust projects should declare `slophammer-rs dry` for native copied-block
duplicate detection.

### `rust.mutation-required`

Rust projects should declare mutation testing, normally through `cargo-mutants`.
The mutation command may live in normal CI, nightly CI, manual CI, or scripts.

### `rust.unsafe-policy-required`

Rust projects should declare an unsafe-code policy in `slophammer.yml`.
`policy: forbid` fails unsafe blocks, unsafe functions, unsafe traits, unsafe
impls, and unsafe extern blocks unless covered by a specific allow entry with a
reason.

### `rust.dependency-audit-required`

Rust projects should declare dependency audit checks through `cargo audit`,
`cargo deny`, or an equivalent inspectable command.

### `rust.dependency-boundaries-required`

Rust projects should declare dependency boundaries in `slophammer.yml`.
Slophammer checks local path dependencies in `Cargo.toml`; external crates are
ignored by this rule.

### `ts.mutation-required`

TypeScript projects should declare TypeScript mutation testing, normally through
StrykerJS. Go mutation commands do not satisfy this rule.

### `ts.dependency-boundaries-required`

TypeScript projects should declare dependency boundaries in `slophammer.yml`
and keep imports inside those boundaries.

If no TypeScript boundaries are declared, the rule reports a finding. External
package imports are ignored. Relative imports are resolved against the importing
file.

## Finding Order

Reports sort findings by `rule_id`, then by `path`.

## Machine-Readable Registry

The machine-readable rule registry lives in [`rules.json`](rules.json).
